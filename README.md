> **Revolutionary software-based in-ear monitoring system that achieves professional-grade ultra-low latency while leveraging existing hardware investments.**

## 🎯 The Problem

Traditional IEM systems cost **$10,000+** for just 4 musicians, locking out 850,000+ churches and local bands from professional monitoring. Current software solutions suffer from unacceptable latency (10-15ms vs. <1ms required for professional use).

## ⚡ Our Solution

Syntri is a complete software stack that:

- **Achieves professional-grade latency** (<3ms, targeting <1ms) 
- **Leverages existing hardware** instead of replacing it
- **Costs 90% less** ($299 setup + $29/month vs. $10,000+)
- **Scales infinitely** with software updates

## 🏆 Key Features

### Ultra-Low Latency Engine
- **<3ms end-to-end latency** with professional hardware
- Custom codec with ML prediction optimization
- Hardware-accelerated processing where available

### Universal Hardware Support
